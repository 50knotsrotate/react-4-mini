# Project Summary

In this project, we will create a very basic React application from scratch that makes use of multiple routes. We will be using the `react-router-dom` package, specifically v4. You can find more documentation to read on your own time here: <a href="https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/philosophy">Click Me!</a>

## Live Example

## Setup

* `Fork` and `clone` this repository.
* `cd` into the project.
* Run `create-react-app ./` to get a React boilerplate.
  * Delete `README.md` and rename `README.old.md` back to `README.md`.

## Step 1

### Summary 

In this step, we will create three basic components that will be used later for three separate routes.

### Instructions

* Open `src/`.
* Create a `Route1.js`, `Route2.js`, and `Route3.js`.
* All three `Router#.js` files should be very basic state-less components.

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> src/Route1.js </code> </summary>

```js
import React from 'react';

export default function Route1() {
  return (
    <div>
      Route 1 here!
    </div>
  )
}
```

</details>

<details>

<summary> <code> src/Route2.js </code> </summary>

```js
import React from 'react';

export default function Route2() {
  return (
    <div>
      Route 2 here!
    </div>
  )
}
```

</details>

<details>

<summary> <code> src/Route3.js </code> </summary>

```js
import React from 'react';

export default function Route3() {
  return (
    <div>
      Route 3 here!
    </div>
  )
}
```

</details>

## Step 2

### Summary

In this step, we will add the `react-router-dom` package to our React project.

### Instructions

* Run `npm install --save react-router-dom`.
